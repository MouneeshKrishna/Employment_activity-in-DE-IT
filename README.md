# Employment_activity-in-DE-IT
This data is available on the Eurostat database and kaggle
I was curious about the employment activity of European Union, especially in Germany and Italy.
Using SQL I filtered the dataset where it contains only Germany and Italian employment activity and
for the age group of 20-64. This is age group occupies 20% of all data according to kaggle. Since I also fall
into this group, I tried to do this only.
The visualizations are done in Tableau. I am attaching the link here for the dashboard.
